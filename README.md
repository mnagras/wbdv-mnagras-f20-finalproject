Final Project Repository for Web Development
The project is to create a website for an online grocery store. It will have two main users: buyers and sellers. 
The buyers would use the website:
  to search and browse for items
  Order items and pay for them
  Mark their favorite items.

The sellers should be able to:
  see what items are in and out of stock and update the grocery list when items get added or removed
  track and review orders made by customers
  Calculate total profits.
