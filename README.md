Final Project Repository for Web Development


The project is to create a website for a social media site about food. It will have two main users: customers and admins. 
The customers would use the website:
  to search and browse for items
  Mark their favorite items.

The admins should be able to:
  track and review actions made by customers on the site
  make sure no one is doing any that harms the site and other members
  delete users and products from the site as they see fit
